      <p>
        My journey in software engineering has been enriched by hands-on projects and training. Currently, I am undergoing software engineering training at ALX, where I am refining my skills in full-stack development. I have also been working on a portfolio project to build an E-Learning Platform with Progress Tracking, which showcases my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies.
