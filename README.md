   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Back-End

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (if not already created):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
